# Ascending-Descending-Order-Sorter
A simple python program to sort a few numbers in ascending or descending order.
You need to give in a few inputs: 
1. The number of numbers in the list
2. What type of sorting you want (A for Ascending, D for Descending)
3. The numbers in the list (depends on the first input)
Then an output will be generated which will give the numbers in ascending or descending order (depending on what you chose)
